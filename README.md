## Sleeper
Tired of searching for a program to put the computer to sleep without crapware, bloatware and other grayware stuff, I forced myself to write my own solution. Lately I fall asleep a lot with the stream on, that's why this program was created to prevent unnecessary energy consumption.

The program is located in system tray after starting. If you want the program to be active after system startup, just add a shortcut to system autostart. The task of the program is to perform a certain action (e.g. turning off the computer) after a certain period of inactivity, alternatively, the program can perform the action at a specific fixed time.
